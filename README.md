# A very outdated animated resume of mine

This was a resume that was supposed to show my "impressive" skills with web technologies... Back in 2011

This resume was the first real front-end project I did :)

# Want to give it a try?

If you remember how to use the `make` command, then you can simply run :

    mkdir js # It seems the Makefile doesn't handle dir creation...
    make all

And it will generate the js bundle.

You can then open the `index.html` in your favorite browser
